Jira Issue Cloner

This script automates cloning a Jira issue into one or more target projects, preserving fields like summary, description, issue type, assignee, and versions. It is designed for organizations using Atlassian Jira Cloud.

🔑 Requirements
Node.js 18+
A Jira API token from your Atlassian account
Permissions to create issues in the target projects

📋 Setup
Generate your API token
Go to Atlassian API Tokens (https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) and create a new token.
Copy and save it securely.

Create a .env file in your project root:

JIRA_BASE=https://yourdomain.atlassian.net
JIRA_USER=your-email@company.com
JIRA_TOKEN=your_api_token

JIRA_BASE → Your Jira site URL
JIRA_USER → Your Atlassian login email
JIRA_TOKEN → Token from step 1

Define target projects and versions:

File targets.js lists where issues should be cloned.:

[
  { "project": "X", "fixVersions": ["0.0.1"] },
  { "project": "X", "fixVersions": ["0.0.2"] }
]

Adjusts accordingly. You can add as many target projects as needed.

▶️ Run the Script

Install dependencies:
npm install

Change source issue:
<SOURCE_ISSUE_KEY> on index.js.

Run the clone script:
npm run start PROJ-123

The script will:
Fetch the source issue you configured (SOURCE_ISSUE_KEY inside index.js)
Create new issues in each project defined in targets.json
Assign the requested fixVersions (and affectsVersions if configured in Jira)
Check for attachments and zip JIRA unsupported files before uploading

📦 Building Executable Package

This project can be packaged into standalone executables that don't require Node.js installation:

Build for all platforms:
npm run build

Build for specific platforms:
npm run build:win     # Windows .exe
npm run build:mac     # macOS binary  
npm run build:linux   # Linux binary

The executables will be created in the `dist/` directory.

✅ Distribution Benefits:
- No Node.js installation required on target machines
- No source code visible to end users
- Single executable file (~48MB) contains everything needed
- Cross-platform compatible

📋 Using the Executable:
1. Copy the executable file (e.g., `clone-master.exe`) to target machine
2. Create a `.env` file in the same directory with your JIRA credentials
3. Create a `targets.json` file in the same directory with your target project configurations
4. Run the executable: `./clone-master.exe PROJ-123`

⚠️ Important: Both `.env` and `targets.json` files must be located in the same directory as the executable for the application to work properly.

⚠️ Notes
If errors about affectsVersions appear, ask your Jira admin to add the Affects Versions field to the Create Issue screen in the target project(s).
The script never deletes or moves the original issue; it only creates new independent clones.
