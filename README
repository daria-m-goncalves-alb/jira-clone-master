Jira Issue Cloner

This script automates cloning a Jira issue into one or more target projects, preserving fields like summary, description, issue type, assignee, and versions. It is designed for organizations using Atlassian Jira Cloud.

üîë Requirements
Node.js 18+
A Jira API token from your Atlassian account
Permissions to create issues in the target projects

üìã Setup
Generate your API token
Go to Atlassian API Tokens (https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) and create a new token.
Copy and save it securely.

Create a .env file in your project root:

JIRA_BASE=https://yourdomain.atlassian.net
JIRA_USER=your-email@company.com
JIRA_TOKEN=your_api_token

JIRA_BASE ‚Üí Your Jira site URL
JIRA_USER ‚Üí Your Atlassian login email
JIRA_TOKEN ‚Üí Token from step 1

Define target projects and versions:

File targets.js lists where issues should be cloned.:

[
  { "project": "X", "fixVersions": ["0.0.1"] },
  { "project": "X", "fixVersions": ["0.0.2"] }
]

Adjusts accordingly. You can add as many target projects as needed.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Script

Install dependencies:
npm install

Run the clone script:
npm run start

The script will:
Fetch the source issue you configured (SOURCE_ISSUE_KEY inside clone.js)
Create new issues in each project defined in targets.json
Assign the requested fixVersions (and affectsVersions if configured in Jira)

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
If errors about affectsVersions appear, ask your Jira admin to add the Affects Versions field to the Create Issue screen in the target project(s).
The script never deletes or moves the original issue; it only creates new independent clones.
